  # Smart House Demo

The Smart House Dashboard Demo is a web-based application that showcases the potential of controlling and monitoring various aspects of a smart home from a single interface. The dashboard provides users with the ability to manage lighting, temperature, and appliances in different sections of the home in an efficient and convenient way. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Please note that this is a demo version of the Smart House Dashboard and does not provide full functionality or control over a real smart home.
